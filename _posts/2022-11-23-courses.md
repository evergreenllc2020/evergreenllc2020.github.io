### Generate photorealistic human faces using GAN 
[Course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/generate-photorealistic-human-faces-using-gan/?couponCode=99C1BE7474F68349831A) 

This course teaches you on how to build GAN using open source Tensorflow, Python, and Jupyter framework.  
You will work along with me step by step to build following answers
* Learn to generate synthetic yet photorealistic human faces using GAN
* Build a strong foundation in GAN with this tutorial for intermediate developers.
* Understanding of  GAN
* Learn DCGAN and CNN from scratch
* Learn Applications of GAN 
* Learn to code a Generator network using Tensorflow
* Learn to code the Discriminator network using Tensorflow
* Learn to code training of DCGAN model
* User Jupyter Notebook for programming
* Build a realistic photo generator using DCGAN

No prior knowledge of CNN or GAN is assumed. I'll be covering topics like CNN, Generator, GAN, and DCGAN from scratch. 

Jobs in the GAN area are plentiful, and being able to learn it with Python and Tensorflow will give you a strong edge. BERT is  state of art language model and surpasses all prior techniques in natural language processing. 

GAN is becoming very popular. Google, Yahoo, Bing and Youtube are few famous examples of GAN systems in action.  GAN engines are vital in synthetic image generation.  Learning GAN with Tensorflow will help you become a Computer Vision Machine learning engineer which is in high demand.

A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips  Learning the fundamentals of text classification h puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Python and Jupyter are free, easy to learn, have excellent documentation. Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) world.

No prior knowledge of word embedding or BERT is assumed. I'll be covering topics like Word Embeddings, BERT, and Glove from scratch. 

Jobs in the NLP area are plentiful, and being able to learn text classification with BERT will give you a strong edge. BERT is state of art language model and surpasses all prior techniques in natural language processing. 

Google uses BERT for text classification systems. Text classifications are vital in social media.  Learning text classification with BERT and Tensorflow 2.4 will help you become a natural language processing (NLP) developer which is in high demand.



### Build iOS mobile application for Question Answering with BERT embeddings
[Course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-ios-question-answering-app-with-bert/?couponCode=E310C68D1A198D14A955) 
This course teaches you step by step on how tp build iOS question answering application. It explores the world of machine learning from application developer's perspective. It explains the world of word embeddings which is fundamental technology behind text processing. As Andrew Ng has said "AI is new electricity". The course highlight difference among AI (Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and deep learning.  It also teaches few embedding technologies like glove, word2vec and BERT.

BERT is state of art transformer model developed by Google and has proven to be equivalent of CNN in computer vision technology. This course uses pretrained BERT model and explains how to use it in IOS question answering app.

The students once armed with this knowledge will be able to demonstrate their command  on machine learning and can use this technology for several different apps. 

The author assumes that the student does not have any background in machine learning.

The course is structured as follows
* App Preview : Shows preview of app that we are going to build
* Embeddings : Explains what word embeddings are and why are they important
* Deep Neural Network : It covers fundamentals of deep learning, and multi layer perceptron
* BERT, Glove, Word2Vec : Popular word embedding technologies
* Build UI from scratch :  Shows how to build UI by using basic controls in iOS swift
* Step by Step Coding : Each function is explained in details with step by step walkthrough of the code
* Text to Speech and Speech to text : This sections explains how to use test to speech and speech top text conversion libraries in iOS app so that user can speak question into the app and hear the answer . This is extremely useful for physically challenged users who can not type using keyboard
*Run the app on iPhone : Shows the flow of the app on the phone.
