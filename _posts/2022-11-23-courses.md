### Generate photorealistic human faces using GAN 
[Course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/generate-photorealistic-human-faces-using-gan/?couponCode=99C1BE7474F68349831A) 

This course teaches you on how to build GAN using open source Tensorflow, Python, and Jupyter framework.  
You will work along with me step by step to build following answers
* Learn to generate synthetic yet photorealistic human faces using GAN
* Build a strong foundation in GAN with this tutorial for intermediate developers.
* Understanding of  GAN
* Learn DCGAN and CNN from scratch
* Learn Applications of GAN 
* Learn to code a Generator network using Tensorflow
* Learn to code the Discriminator network using Tensorflow
* Learn to code training of DCGAN model
* User Jupyter Notebook for programming
* Build a realistic photo generator using DCGAN

No prior knowledge of CNN or GAN is assumed. I'll be covering topics like CNN, Generator, GAN, and DCGAN from scratch. 

Jobs in the GAN area are plentiful, and being able to learn it with Python and Tensorflow will give you a strong edge. BERT is  state of art language model and surpasses all prior techniques in natural language processing. 

GAN is becoming very popular. Google, Yahoo, Bing and Youtube are few famous examples of GAN systems in action.  GAN engines are vital in synthetic image generation.  Learning GAN with Tensorflow will help you become a Computer Vision Machine learning engineer which is in high demand.
